# Rock VS Mine Prediction Model ðŸª¨VS ðŸ’£

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. It uses the Sonar Dataset, which contains data representing sonar returns bounced off different objects. The goal is to correctly identify whether the object detected is a rock (harmless) or a mine (dangerous) based on sonar readings.




## ðŸ“ŒSome essential libraries used 


```bash
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

## ðŸ’¡What I learned ? 

The learning outcomes from this project include:

- Understanding Supervised Learning: To use labeled data to train a model for binary classification (Rock vs. Mine).
- Model Implementation: Gain experience with implementing logistic regression using Scikit-learn.
- Data Preprocessing: Learn how to reshape input data and convert it into formats compatible with machine learning models.
- Model Evaluation: Learned how to evaluate model predictions and interpret results.
